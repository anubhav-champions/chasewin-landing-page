                                “Games are not just a diversion. Games could make you feel.” – Sid Meier.
                                This quote sums up our approach to bringing gaming to the world, depending on how you view it. At a macro level, we wanted to change the way games could make you feel. That would mean, revolutionising games to engage the user at a deeper level. As a technology-driven company, there was only one way we knew how to achieve it. That is, through technology.
